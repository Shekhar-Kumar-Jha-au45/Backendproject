Title= ''Go-Grocery''

Project Description:-
1. As a full stack aspirant i am creating a development project named as “Go-Grocery’’ which was a web-application which was based on the design that whenever a user enters in our website he/she can see the about us page and after next module all the available items available at our store are visible & he can buy or add to cart the products based on product price and his need. And also there was a recipe section in the bottom of the website which excites user as there are recipes provided by famous cooks and foodies and in case user wants to add any recipe he can also add the same over there and visitors can see their thoughts.
2.I am creating a Complete Responsive Dynamic Website using HTML, CSS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB & Mongoose for database.
3.We will go through NPM packages, Validator to make our contact form proper and Whenever any user fills the contact us form or whenever a user is trying to add their receipes  the data will get stored to our MongoDB Compass DataBase using Mongoose.
4. I am also  adding the specification where user can add to cart their products and also can wishlist them for further purposes.
5.In coming days i will be adding some more functionalities and subpages to my website to make it look more dynamic and user can use easily our website and continue shopping .
